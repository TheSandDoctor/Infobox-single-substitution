"'''Golden Brown'''" is a song by the English rock band [[the Stranglers]]. It was released as a 7" single in December 1981 in the United States and in January 1982 in the United Kingdom, on [[Liberty Records|Liberty]]. It was the second single released from the band's sixth album ''[[La folie (album)|La folie]]''. It peaked at No. 2 in the [[UK Singles Chart]], the band's highest ever placing in that chart.<ref>{{cite book|first= David |last= Roberts |year= 2006 |title= [[British Hit Singles & Albums]] |edition= 19th |publisher= [[Guinness World Records|Guinness World Records Limited]] |location= London |isbn= 1-904994-10-5 |page= 535}}</ref>

In January 2014, ''[[NME]]'' ranked the song as No. 488 on its list of the ''500 Greatest Songs of All Time''.<ref>{{cite magazine|title= The 500 Greatest Songs Of All Time – 500-401 |magazine= [[NME]] |url= http://www.nme.com/photos/the-500-greatest-songs-of-all-time-500-401/ |accessdate= 28 July 2016}}</ref> It has also been recorded by many other artists.

==Overview==
Originally featured on the group's album ''[[La folie (album)|La folie]]'', which was released in November 1981, and later on the USA pressings of ''[[Feline (The Stranglers album)|Feline]]'', "Golden Brown" was released as a single in December 1981, and was accompanied by a video. It reached No. 2 in the official [[UK Singles Chart]] in February 1982, remaining there for two weeks behind [[double A-side]]d record "[[Town Called Malice|Town Called Malice/Precious]]" by [[the Jam]].<ref name="UK"/><ref>{{cite web|title= Official Singles Chart Top 100: 14 February 1982 – 20 February 1982 |publisher= [[Official Charts Company]] |accessdate= 7 March 2017 |url= http://www.officialcharts.com/charts/singles-chart/19820214/7501/}}</ref>

The comparatively conservative [[BBC Radio 2]], at that time a [[Middle of the road (music)|middle-of-the-road <small>(MOR)</small>]] music radio station, decided to make the record the single of the week, a surprising step considering the band were almost as notorious as [[Sex Pistols]] only a few years before.

The band claimed that the song's lyrics were akin to an aural [[Rorschach test]] and that people only heard in it what they wanted to hear, although this did not prevent persistent allegations that the lyrics alluded to [[heroin]].

The single was a top 10 hit around the world, including Australia. It was also featured in the film ''[[Snatch (film)|Snatch]]''  and is included on its soundtrack album.<ref name="snatch"/>

==Meaning==
There has been much controversy surrounding the lyrics. In his book ''The Stranglers Song By Song'' (2001), [[Hugh Cornwell]] states "'Golden Brown' works on two levels. It's about [[heroin]] and also about a girl." Essentially the lyrics describe how "both provided me with pleasurable times."<ref>{{cite book|first= Hugh |last= Cornwell |authorlink= Hugh Cornwell |first2= Jim |last2= Drury |title= The Stranglers Song By Song |year= 2001 |publisher= Sanctuary Publishing Ltd |isbn= 1-86074-362-5}}</ref>

==Musical composition==
The main body of the song has a [[Time signature|3/4]] feel and is pitched halfway between the keys of [[E minor]] and [[E-flat minor]], possibly to accommodate the tuning of the [[harpsichord]]. The instrumental introduction, in (a very flat) [[B minor]], is unconventional. The keyboard and harpsichord vamp in 3/4, and every fourth bar is in [[Time signature|4/4]].  The music was largely written by keyboardist [[Dave Greenfield]] and drummer [[Jet Black]], with lyrics by singer/guitarist [[Hugh Cornwell]].<ref>{{cite web|title= Golden Brown – Song Review |publisher= AllMusic. All Media Network |url= http://www.allmusic.com/song/golden-brown-mt0015076815 |accessdate= 9 July 2014}}</ref>

The BBC newsreader [[Bill Turnbull]] attempted to [[waltz]] to the song in the 2005 series of ''[[Strictly Come Dancing]]''. In February 2012, when interviewing Stranglers bassist [[Jean-Jacques Burnel]] on ''BBC Breakfast'', Turnbull described the attempted dance as "a disaster", Burnel responded that the alternating time signatures made "Golden Brown" impossible to dance to; in contrast, a song written entirely in 6/8 is not unusual in waltzing.

==Music video==
[[File:The Stranglers - Golden Brown.jpg|thumb|200px|Two shots from ''Golden Brown'': the band performing the song in Leighton House and as explorers.]]
The video for "Golden Brown", directed by Lindsey Clennell, depicts the band members both as explorers in an [[Arab world|Arabian country]] and non Arab Muslim Countries (sequences include images of [[Giza pyramid complex|the Pyramids]] as well as the explorers studying a map of [[Egypt]]) in the 1920s and performers for a fictional "Radio Cairo". 

In addition to the Pyramids, the video is intercut with [[stock footage]] of the [[Mir-i-Arab Madrasah]] in [[Bukhara]], the [[Shah Mosque]] in [[Isfahan]], and [[Great Sphinx of Giza|Great Sphinx]], [[Felucca]]s sailing, [[Bedouin]]s riding and [[camel racing]] in the [[United Arab Emirates]]. The performance scenes were filmed in the [[Leighton House Museum]] in [[Holland Park]], [[London]].
