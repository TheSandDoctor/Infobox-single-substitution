"'''American Pie'''" is a song by American singer and songwriter [[Don McLean]]. Recorded and released on the ''[[American Pie (album)|American Pie]]'' album in 1971, the single was the number-one US hit for four weeks in 1972 and also topped the charts in Australia, Canada, and New Zealand. In the UK, the single reached number 2, where it stayed for 3 weeks, on its original 1972 release while a reissue in 1991 reached No. 12.<ref>[http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/epm/18512?q=American+pie+Don+Mclean&search=quick&pos=2&_start=1#firsthit] {{dead link|date=October 2016}}</ref> The song was listed as the No. 5 song on the [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]] project [[Songs of the Century]]. A truncated version of the song was covered by [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] in 2000 and reached No. 1 in several countries, including the United Kingdom, Canada and Australia. McLean's combined version is the fourth longest song to enter the Billboard Hot 100, at the time of release it was the longest, in addition to being the longest song to reach #1.<ref>[https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/chart-beat/7549893/longest-shortest-hot-100-hits-kendrick-lamar-beyonce longest shortest billboard songs]</ref>

The repeatedly mentioned phrase "[[The Day the Music Died|the day the music died]]" refers to the plane crash in 1959 which killed early rock and roll performers [[Buddy Holly]], [[The Big Bopper]], and [[Ritchie Valens]]. (The crash was not known by that name until after McLean's song became a hit.) The meaning of the other lyrics has long been debated, and for decades, McLean declined to explain the symbolism behind the many characters and events mentioned. However, the overall theme of the song is the loss of innocence of the early rock and roll generation as symbolized by the plane crash which claimed the lives of three of its heroes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://understandingamericanpie.com/ |title=Understanding American Pie – Interpretation of Don Mclean's epic anthem to the passing of an era. |author= |date= |work=UnderstandingAmericanPie.com |access-date=March 30, 2017 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030906142212/https://www.understandingamericanpie.com/ |archivedate=September 6, 2003 |df= }}</ref>

In 2017, McLean's original recording was selected for preservation in the [[National Recording Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]] as being "culturally, historically, or artistically significant".<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.loc.gov/item/prn-17-029/ | title=National Recording Registry Picks Are "Over the Rainbow" | work=Library of Congress | date=March 29, 2017 | access-date=March 29, 2017}}</ref>

While it has been claimed that Don McLean began writing the song in upstate [[Saratoga Springs, New York]], at [[Caffè Lena|Caffe Lena]],<ref name="search.proquest.com">[http://search.proquest.com/docview/1670897932 Don McLean's 'American Pie' fetches $1.2M ''Telegram & Gazette'' (Worcester, Mass) 8 April 2015: A.2.]</ref> a 2011 ''New York Times'' article quotes Don McLean as disputing this claim.<ref name="nytimes.com">{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/30/nyregion/don-mclean-sets-record-straight-on-american-pie-origins.html|title=‘American Pie’ Still Homemade, but With a New Twist|author=|date=November 30, 2011|work=The New York Times|access-date=March 30, 2017}}</ref> Some employees at Caffe Lena claim that he started writing the song there, and then continued to write the song in both [[Cold Spring, New York]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.christies.com/about/press-center/releases/pressrelease.aspx?pressreleaseid=7743 |title=Release: Don Mclean’s Original Manuscript For "American Pie" To Be Sold At Christie's New York, 7 April 2015 |publisher=Christie's.com |date=February 13, 2015 |access-date=February 14, 2015}}</ref> and [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]].<ref name="refute" /> McLean claims that the song was only written in Cold Spring and Philadelphia.<ref name="nytimes.com"/> Tin & Lint, a bar on Caroline Street in Saratoga Springs, claims the song was written there, and a plaque marks the table.

===Interpretations===
Except to acknowledge that he first learned about [[Buddy Holly]]'s death on February 3, 1959—McLean was age 13—when he was folding newspapers for his paper route on the morning of February 4, 1959 (the line "February made me shiver/with every paper I'd deliver"), McLean has generally avoided responding to direct questions about the song's lyrics; he has said: "They're beyond analysis. They're poetry."<ref name="search.proquest.com"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.don-mclean.com/?p=68 |page=68|title=American Pie|website= Don McLean.com}}</ref> He also stated in an editorial published in 2009, on the 50th anniversary of the [[The Day the Music Died|crash]] that killed Holly, [[Ritchie Valens]], and [[The Big Bopper|J. P. "The Big Bopper" Richardson]], that writing the first verse of the song exorcised his long-running grief over Holly's death and that he considers the song to be "a big song ... that summed up the world known as America".<ref>{{cite news |last=McLean |first=Don |title=Commentary: Buddy Holly, rock music genius |url=http://www.cnn.com/2009/SHOWBIZ/Music/02/01/mclean.buddy.holly/ |access-date=November 28, 2011 |work=CNN |date=February 1, 2009}}</ref> McLean dedicated the ''American Pie'' album to Holly.

It was also speculated that the song contains numerous references to post-World War II American events (such as the [[Murders of Chaney, Goodman and Schwerner|murders of civil rights workers]] [[James Chaney|Chaney]], [[Andrew Goodman|Goodman]], and [[Michael Schwerner|Schwerner]]),<ref>{{cite web

[[Mike Mills]] of [[R.E.M.]] reflected: "American Pie just made perfect sense to me as a song and that’s what impressed me the most. I could say to people this is how to write songs. When you’ve written at least three songs that can be considered classic that is a very high batting average and if one of those songs happens to be something that a great many people think is one of the greatest songs ever written you’ve not only hit the top of the mountain but you’ve stayed high on the mountain for a long time.”<ref name="skydoc">{{cite AV media | title =Don McLean: An American Troubadour | medium = Television production | publisher = Sky Arts 1 | location = UK |year = 2013}}</ref>

In 2017, Bob Dylan was asked about how he was referenced in the song. "A jester? Sure, the jester writes songs like '[[Masters of War]],' '[[A Hard Rain's a-Gonna Fall|A Hard Rain’s a-Gonna Fall]],' '[[It's Alright, Ma (I'm Only Bleeding)|It’s Alright, Ma]]' – some jester.

In 1999, [["Weird Al" Yankovic]] wrote and recorded a parody of "American Pie".<ref>[http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/epm/62453] {{dead link|date=October 2016}}</ref> Titled "[[The Saga Begins]]", the song recounts the plot of ''[[Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace]]'' from [[Obi-Wan Kenobi]]'s point of view. While McLean gave permission for the parody, he did not make a cameo appearance in its video, despite popular rumor. McLean himself praised the parody, even admitting to almost singing Yankovic's lyrics during his own live performances because his children played the song so often.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://weirdal.com/aaarchive.htm#0999|title="Ask Al" Q&As for September, 1999| accessdate=October 29, 2006 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060902121655/http://www.weirdal.com/aaarchive.htm#0999 |archivedate = September 2, 2006}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theforce.net/jedicouncil/interview/weirdal.asp |title=Jedi Council – Interviews Weird Al Yankovic |publisher=TheForce.Net |date=September 14, 1980 |accessdate=May 20, 2010}}</ref>

===Background===
American singer [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] released a cover version of the song in March 2000 to promote the soundtrack of her film ''[[The Next Best Thing]]'' (2000), with the song being serviced to radio on February 2.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://madonna.com/news/title/american-pie-hits-radio |title=American Pie Hits Radio |publisher=Madonna.com |accessdate=December 19, 2015}}</ref> Her cover is much shorter than the original (it contains only the beginning of the first verse and all of the second and sixth verses) and was recorded as a [[dance-pop]] song. It was co-produced by Madonna and [[William Orbit]] and released on the singer's Maverick label, after [[Rupert Everett]] (Madonna's co-star in ''The Next Best Thing'') had convinced her to cover the song for the film's soundtrack.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/629526.stm |title=Madonna's piece of American Pie |date=3 February 2000 |publisher=BBC News |access-date=4 May 2015}}</ref><ref>[http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/epm/54494?q=Madonna+American+Pie&search=quick&pos=3&_start=1#firsthit] {{dead link|date=October 2016}}</ref>

===Reception===
Released in March 2000, the song was a worldwide hit, reaching No. 1 in many countries, including the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, Iceland, Italy, Germany (her first since "[[La Isla Bonita]]", in 1987), [[Switzerland]], Austria, and [[Finland]]. The song was the 19th best selling of 2000 in the UK and the 9th best selling of 2000 in Italy. The single was not released commercially in the United States, but it reached No. 29 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] due to strong radio airplay.

''[[NME]]'' gave it a negative review, saying that it was "sub-karaoke fluff" and that "it's a blessing she didn't bother recording the whole thing."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nme.com/reviews/madonna/2653 |title=NME Track Reviews – American Pie |work=NME |date=February 26, 2000 |accessdate=October 29, 2012}}</ref> Chuck Taylor from ''Billboard,'' on the other hand, was impressed by the recording and commented, "Applause to Madonna for not pandering to today's temporary trends and for challenging programmers to broaden their playlists. ...

The music video, filmed in the Southern USA and in London<ref>Ciccone, Christopher (2008) ''Life with my Sister Madonna'', Simon & Schuster: New York, p.278.</ref> and directed by [[Philipp Stölzl]], depicts a diverse array of ordinary Americans, including scenes showing same-sex couples kissing. Throughout the music video Madonna, who is wearing a tiara on her head, dances and sings in front of a large American flag.

Two official versions of the video were produced, the first of which now appears on Madonna's greatest-hits DVD compilation, ''[[Celebration: The Video Collection|Celebration]]'', and was released as the official video worldwide. The second version was issued along with the "Humpty Remix", a more upbeat and dance-friendly version of the song. This video was aired on MTV's dance channel in the United States to promote the film ''[[The Next Best Thing]]'', starring Madonna and [[Rupert Everett]]; it contains totally different footage and new outtakes of the original and omits the lesbian kiss. Everett, who provides backing vocals in the song, is also featured in the video.<!-- per WP:PLOT -->
