'''"The Ballad of the Green Berets"''' is a patriotic song in the [[ballad (music)|ballad]] style about the [[United States Army Special Forces|Green Berets]], an elite [[Special Operations Forces|special force]] in the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]]. It is one of the few popular songs of the Vietnam War years to cast the military in a positive light and in 1966 became a major hit, reaching No. 1 for five weeks on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] and four weeks on [[Cashbox (magazine)|Cashbox]]. Ultimately, the song was named [[Billboard Year-End Hot 100 singles of 1966|Billboard's #10 single for the year 1966]].  It was also a crossover smash, reaching No. 1 on ''Billboard's'' Easy Listening chart and No. 2 on ''Billboard's'' Country survey.

The song was written by then [[Staff Sergeant|Staff Sgt.]] [[Barry Sadler]], beginning when he was training to be a Special Forces medic. The author Robin Moore, who wrote the book, ''The Green Berets'', helped Sadler write the lyrics and get a recording contract with RCA Records.

The lyrics were written, in part, in honor of Green Beret U.S. Army Specialist 5 James Gabriel, Jr., the first [[native Hawaiian]] to die in Vietnam, who was killed by Viet Cong gunfire while on a training mission with the South Vietnamese Army on April 8, 1962.<ref>{{cite web | last=Mizutani | first=Ron | title=First Native Hawaiian Killed in Vietnam Conflict Honored | date=May 18, 2010 | work=KHON2.com | publisher=[[KHON-TV]] | url=http://www.khon2.com/content/news/developingstories/story/First-Native-Hawaiian-Killed-in-Vietnam-Conflict/iSrtWYe-DEmrkW4dYH_m2Q.cspx | accessdate=March 12, 2011 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110616211947/http://www.khon2.com/content/news/developingstories/story/First-Native-Hawaiian-Killed-in-Vietnam-Conflict/iSrtWYe-DEmrkW4dYH_m2Q.cspx | archivedate=June 16, 2011 | df= }}</ref> One verse mentioned Gabriel by name, but it was not used in the recorded version.<ref>''I'm a Lucky One'' by Staff Sgt. Barry Sadler (Macmillan 1967, pp.&nbsp;80–81)</ref>

Sadler recorded the song and eleven other tunes in New York in December 1965. The song and album, "Ballads of the Green Berets," were released in January 1966. He performed the song on television on January 30, 1966 on ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]'', and on other TV shows including ''Hollywood Palace'' and ''The Jimmy Dean Show''.

== Popularity ==
The song was the No. 1 hit in the U.S. for the five weeks, spanning March 1966 and the No. 1 hit on the ''[[Cashbox (magazine)|Cashbox]]'' end of the year chart for 1966; also the No. 21 song of the 1960s as ranked by [[Joel Whitburn]]. The single sold more than nine million copies; the album, more than two million. 

"The Ballad of the Green Berets" is currently used as one of the four primary [[marching band|marching tunes]] of the [[Fightin' Texas Aggie Band]].

== In film ==
The song is heard in a choral rendition by [[Ken Darby]] in the 1968 [[John Wayne]] film, ''[[The Green Berets (film)|The Green Berets]]'', based on [[Robin Moore]]'s book. The film's score was not released as an album until ''[[Film Score Monthly]]'' released it in 2005. A movie [[tie-in]] featuring artwork from the film and a [[cover version]] by [[Ennio Morricone]] was released in Europe, though the album's other tracks were from ''[[A Fistful of Dollars]]'' and ''[[For a Few Dollars More]]''.

The song appears in the films ''[[More American Graffiti]]'' and ''[[Canadian Bacon]]''. It can also be heard in the gun show scene of the 2002 film ''[[Showtime (film)|Showtime]]'', and in the film ''[[Jesus' Son]]'', in a scene that features a hitch-hiking [[Jack Black]].

A vinyl copy of "The Ballad of the Green Berets" makes a brief appearance in "[[The Simpsons]]" episode "[[Homer's Phobia]]", from the show's eighth season. Guest star and filmmaker [[John Waters (filmmaker)|John Waters]] is seen, near the five-minute mark, flipping through Homer and Marge's record collection; Sadler's hit is amongst them.

Bill Murray briefly sang "Green Berets" in the 1980 film ''[[Caddyshack]]'' during his final attempt to kill the gopher.

The cast of the 2018 movie [[12 Strong]] sing the tune as their Chinook helicopter takes off.

== Covers and derivatives ==
Many American [[cover version]]s of the song appeared recorded by artists ranging from [[Kate Smith]] and [[Duane Eddy]] to unknown artists singing on various [[drugstore records]].

The punk rock band [[The F.U.'s]] performed a cover of the song, featured on the album ''[[This Is Boston, Not L.A.]]''

Many cover versions are in different languages rewritten to reference local units; these include:
* A German version (''Hundert Mann und ein Befehl''), sung by [[Freddy Quinn]] and later again by [[Heidi Brühl]] had considerable success in [[Germany]]. The German version is a song ''against'' the war. It rejects any sacrifice, not only for the son, but for the father as well. [[Freddy Quinn]] sings the song from the point of view of the reluctant but forced soldier,{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} Heidi Bruhl from the point of view of the crying girlfriend of the soldier.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} Freddy Quinn's version was later cover by [[Welle: Erdball]] and also by [[Cryptic Wintermoon]].
* The Royal Netherlands Army's [[Korps Commandotroepen]] (KCT) use the original lyrics. The only difference is that in the chorus, instead of singing "''These are men, America's best''", they sing "''These are men, The Netherlands' best''". Also in the final chorus, referring to the son of a deceased Green Beret, they sing "''Make him one of The Netherlands' best''". This version of the original ballad is sung to recruits who have successfully completed the harsh Basic Commando Training (ECO), and who receive their Green Beret.
* [[Rhodesian]] singer-songwriter [[John Edmond]] recorded the "Ballad of the Green Berets" with reference to the soldiers of the [[Rhodesian Light Infantry]] (RLI), commando-style [[fireforce]] units of Rhodesian Security Forces who wore [[berets]] of [[green]] [[color]]. A "Ballad of the Red Beret" was sung by the Rhodesian Ministry of Internal Affairs at their battlecamp in [[Chikurubi]]. In [[South Africa]], the "Ballad of the Green Berets" was recorded as the "Ballad of the Maroon Berets". The [[Maroon beret]] is a symbol of the [[South African Special Forces Brigade]] and the [[South African 44 Parachute Regiment]]. Also this song was re-recorded by South African opera singer Leonore Veenemans as "My Land Suid-Afrika".
* The Swedish version "Balladen om den blå baskern" is a salute to the Swedish soldiers serving in the United Nations' peace-keeping forces (the Blue Berets). It was sung by [[Anita Lindblom]].
* The Italian version is called ''La Ballata del Soldato'', sung by [[Quartetto Cetra]].
* In the [[Swiss Armed Forces]], the Infantry Officer's School uses a [[Languages of Switzerland|quadrlingual]] version (named The [[Infantry]] Ballad) of the song as their anthem, in salute to the bonds created by the very harsh training undertaken by the cadets as well as to the sense of duty (and their motto, [[Exemplo Ducemus]]) they vow to respect. It is sung everyday onwards to the morning [[wikt:roll call|roll call]], before the [[National anthem of Switzerland|National Anthem]].
* In 1966, Bernard Tapy (real name [[Bernard Tapie]], businessman and politician), recorded an adaptation in French as "Passeport pour le soleil"<ref>[http://www.encyclopedisque.fr/disque/23082.html ≪Passeport pour le soleil. Bernard Tapy. 1966. RCA Victor≫], sur le site Encyclopédisque</ref>

== Parodies ==
* In 1968, The Beach Bums, an ad hoc group featuring a young [[Bob Seger]], recorded "The Ballad of the Yellow Beret", chronicling the adventures of a [[draft dodger]].  The record was withdrawn after a [[cease and desist]] letter from Sadler.
* [[The Residents]] parodied the song on their ''[[Third Reich & Roll]]'' album.
* Another parody was used on the episode of ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' that [[William Shatner]] hosted in 1986, called "Ollie North, The Mute Marine." Shatner participated in the sketch, outfitted in a USMC Class A uniform, alluding to [[Oliver North]]'s refusal to speak about his participation in the [[Iran-Contra Affair]]; Shatner spoke no words.
* The song is used to humorous effect in [[Michael Moore]]'s film ''[[Canadian Bacon (film)|Canadian Bacon]]'' as ill-informed Americans prepare for an invasion by [[Canada]].
* The movie ''[[Wag the Dog]]'' includes the fictitious unit 303 Special Forces' song "The Men of the 303", which is played to a similar but original tune written by Huey Lewis for the film.
* In the film ''[[Caddyshack]],'' Carl Spackler, played by [[Bill Murray]], mumbles the song under his breath while he is connecting the wires to the plunger as he prepares for his final battle with his [[gopher (animal)|gopher]] nemesis.
* Comedian Paul Shanklin parodied the song with "Ballad of the Black Beret", referring to the Clinton sex scandal, on his 1999 album ''[[Simply Reprehensible]]''.
* Though its usage here is not a parody, in an episode of ''[[Cheers]],'' Cliff aborts his plans to emigrate to Canada with his love interest when Sam, Woody, and Frasier appeal to his patriotic side by singing this song.
*  The internet critic SF Debris uses the music with lyrics about the Red Shirts in ''Star Trek'' who regularly die on away missions.
