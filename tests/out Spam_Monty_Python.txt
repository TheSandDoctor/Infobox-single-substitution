'''“Spam”''' is a [[Monty Python]] [[sketch comedy|sketch]], first televised in 1970 and written by [[Terry Jones]] and [[Michael Palin]]. In the sketch, two customers are lowered by wires into a [[Greasy spoon|greasy spoon café]] and try to order a [[breakfast]] from a [[menu]] that includes [[spam (food)|Spam]] in almost every dish, much to the consternation of one of the customers.

The televised sketch and several subsequent performances feature [[Terry Jones]] as the [[Waitress]], [[Eric Idle]] as Mr. Bun and [[Graham Chapman]] as Mrs. Bun, who does not like Spam. The original sketch also featured [[John Cleese]] as The [[Hungarian people|Hungarian]] and [[Michael Palin]] as a [[historian]], but this part was left out of the audio version of the sketch recorded for the team's second album ''[[Another Monty Python Record]]'' in 1971. A year later this track was released as the Pythons' first 7" single.

The term ''[[Spamming|spam]]'' in the context of [[electronic communications]] is derived from this sketch.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/spam |title=Spam &ndash; Definition and More from the Free Merriam-Webster Dictionary |publisher=Merriam-webster.com |date=31 August 2012 |accessdate=5 July 2013}}</ref>

==Plot==
The three-and-a-half-minute sketch is set in the fictional Green Midget Café in [[Bromley]]. An argument develops between the waitress, who recites a menu in which nearly every dish contains Spam (among them, "[[Lobster Thermidor]] aux crevettes with a [[Mornay sauce]], garnished with [[truffle]] [[pâté]], [[brandy]] and a fried egg on top and Spam"), and Mrs Bun, who does not like Spam. She asks for a dish without Spam, much to the amazement of her Spam-loving husband. The waitress responds to this request with disgust. Mr. Bun offers to take her Spam instead, and asks for a dish containing a lot of Spam and baked beans. The waitress says no, since they are out of baked beans; when Mr. Bun asks for a substitution of Spam, the waitress responds with disgust.

At several points, a group of [[Viking]]s in the restaurant interrupts conversation by loudly singing about Spam. The irate waitress orders them to shut up, but they resume singing more loudly. A [[Hungary|Hungarian]] tourist comes to the counter, trying to order by using a wholly inaccurate [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]]/English phrasebook (a reference to a [[Dirty Hungarian Phrasebook|previous sketch]]). He is rapidly escorted away by a [[Police officer|police constable]].

The sketch abruptly cuts to a historian in a television studio talking about the origin of the Vikings in the café. As he goes on, he begins to increasingly insert the word "Spam" into every sentence ("...and Spam selecting a Spam particular Spam item from the Spam menu, would Spam, Spam, Spam, Spam..."), and the backdrop is raised to reveal the restaurant set behind. The historian joins the Vikings, Mr. and Mrs. Bun are lifted by wires out of the scene, and the singing continues. In the original televised performance, the closing credits begin to scroll with the singing still audible in the background.

==Production notes==
The sketch premiered on 15 December 1970 as the final sketch of the 25th show of ''[[Monty Python's Flying Circus]]'', and the end credits for the episode were changed so every member of the crew has either Spam or some other food item from the menu added to their names. ([[Terry Jones|Spam Terry Jones]], [[Michael Palin|Michael Spam Palin]], [[John Cleese|John Spam John Spam John Spam Cleese]], [[Graham Chapman|Graham Spam Spam Spam Chapman]], [[Eric Idle|Eric Spam Egg and Chips Idle]], [[Terry Gilliam|Terry Spam Sausage Spam Egg Spam Gilliam]], etc.) The sketch became immensely popular.{{fact|date=July 2014}} The word "Spam" is uttered at least 132 times.

This sketch has also been featured in several Monty Python videos including ''[[Parrot Sketch Not Included - 20 Years of Monty Python]]''. A [[lead sheet]] for the song appears in ''[[Monty Python's Big Red Book]]''.

The DVD release of the episode contains a deliberate subtitling error. When the Hungarian tries to order food, his words are "My lower intestine is full of Spam, Egg, Spam, Bacon, Spam, Tomatoes, Spam." Yet the subtitles read "Your intestine is full of [[Spermatozoon|Sperm]]."  This is a continuation of the "[[Dirty Hungarian Phrasebook]]" sketch from the same episode.

The audio version of the sketch excludes the Hungarian and historian, and instead has the Vikings reaching a dramatic [[crescendo]]. The waitress, resigned to these disruptions, mutters "[[Bloody]] Vikings!" In the 2014 version of the sketch performed in ''[[Monty Python Live (Mostly)]]'', one of the Vikings replies "Racist bastard!" before leading the group into an operatic chorus that includes a sampling of "[[Finland (song)|Finland]]" from the team's ''[[Monty Python's Contractual Obligation Album|Contractual Obligation Album]]''.

Spam was a popular food during [[World War II]] in the UK. Although rationed, it was generally easily available and not subject to supply shortages, as were other meats. Thanks to its wartime ubiquity, the British grew heartily tired of it.<ref>''How We Lived Then: A History of Everyday Life in the Second World War'', Norman Longmate, Arrow Books, 1971, pp 142, 159</ref>

==Impact==
The phenomenon, some years later, of marketers drowning out discourse by flooding [[Usenet]] newsgroups and individuals' [[email]] with junk mail advertising messages was named [[Spam (electronic)|spamming]], due to some early internet users that [[flooding|flooded]] forums with the word ''spam''<ref name="autogenerated2">{{cite web|url=http://www.templetons.com/brad/spamterm.html |title=Origin of the term "spam" to mean net abuse |publisher=Templetons.com |date= |accessdate=5 July 2013}}</ref> recounting the repetitive and unwanted presence of spam in the sketch. This phenomenon has been reported in court decisions handed down in lawsuits against spammers – see, for example, ''CompuServe Inc. v. Cyber Promotions, Inc.'', 962 F.Supp. 1015, n. 1 (S.D.Ohio 1997). Furthermore, it has been referenced in an [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]] [[amicus curiae]] brief to the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] in 2014.<ref>https://www.eff.org/files/2013/11/05/eff_amicus_brief_fortres_grand.pdf</ref> The term also is used to refer to mass marketing using junk phone calls or text messages, and has since entered video gaming lingo as a term to refer to producing a large quantity of something, such as rocket-spamming or grenade-spamming.

The [[Python (programming language)|Python]] programming language, named after Monty Python, prefers to use spam, ham, and eggs as [[metasyntactic variable]]s, instead of the traditional [[foo]], [[Bar (computer science)|bar]], and [[Baz (computer science)|baz]]; the name "egg" is also used for an installation [[package format]] for Python libraries.<ref>http://mrtopf.de/blog/en/a-small-introduction-to-python-eggs/</ref>

==Hormel's response==
[[Spam (food)|Spam]] makers [[Hormel]], while never happy with the use of the word ''spam'' for junk email, have been supportive of Monty Python and their sketch. Hormel issued a special tin of Spam for the [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] premiere of [[Eric Idle]]'s ''[[Spamalot]]'', a [[Musical theater|musical]]  based on ''[[Monty Python and the Holy Grail]]''.

The sketch is part of the company's [[Spam Museum]] in [[Austin, Minnesota]], [[United States]], and also mentioned in Spam's on-can advertisements for the product's 70th anniversary in 2007 - although the date of the Python sketch was incorrectly stated to be 1971 instead of 1970.

In 2007 the [[Hormel]] company decided that such publicity was part of their corporate image, possibly for the better, and sponsored a game where their product is strongly associated with Monty Python,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spamspamspamspam.co.uk |title=SPAM® - Monty Python's SPAMALOT - Play this very silly catapult game for fun! |publisher=Spamspamspamspam.co.uk |date= |accessdate=5 July 2013}}</ref> even featuring a product with "Stinky French Garlic" as part of the promotion of ''Spamalot''. For the company's 75th anniversary in 2012, they introduced Sir Can-A-Lot, a knight character, appearing on the product's packaging with the phrase "Glorious SPAM®!".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spam.com/spam-101/history-of-spam|title=History of SPAM|publisher=www.spam.com|accessdate=18 February 2016}}</ref>
